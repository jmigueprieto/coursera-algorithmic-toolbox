# Algorithmic Toolbox

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/jmigueprieto/coursera-algorithmic-toolbox.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/jmigueprieto/coursera-algorithmic-toolbox)

This repo contains a gradle project with my solutions to the programming assignments of [Algorithmic Toolbox](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithmic-toolbox).

This MOOC is really great to learn or review basic algorithmic techniques and test your problem solving skills.

## Assignments

`toolbox.zip` contains starter files in different languages and pdf documents with detailed description of the problems.

Assignments get interesting from week 3 onwards. It covers Greedy Algorithms, Divide and Conquer and Dynamic Programming.
